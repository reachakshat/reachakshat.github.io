Hey!
I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology from Delhi Technological University. I have been working as a researcher for more than 2 years in the field of Natural Language Processing, particularly in the areas of Sentiment and Hate Speech Analysis in Social Media, Trust and Bias Analysis in News, and Low Resource Language Processing and have been able to publish some of work in the same. I have had the opportunity to intern at IBM Research Labs, National University of Singapore, University of Technology Sydney and Delhi Technological University as a researcher in the field of NLP.
